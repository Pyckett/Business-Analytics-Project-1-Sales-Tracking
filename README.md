## Business-Analytics-Project-1-Sales-Tracking

This repository contains a sales analytics project for CSB304 (Data Analytics in Business). The goal of this project is to analyze historical sales data and support the Sales department by providing clear insights into performance of sales, trends, and customer behavior to give direction for business-level decisions. 

An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to help stakeholders monitor sales metrics and identify patterns that can support business-level decision-making as needed. 

## Background
The dataset used represents sales data from "Timeless Transport Models", which is an online wholesale supplier of transporation model collectibles. The dashboard focuses on tracking sales by product line, location, deal size, and customer. Also by identifying monthly trends and top customers.
